Testing
JUnit
JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.

JUnit 5 is the result of JUnit Lambda and its crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.
